# API_GATEWAY
FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- we need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
- using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request
-we can do message validation, response transformation, rate limitation
-We try prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middleware end.
